            <strong>Couscous (dish)</strong>

            <p>
              Couscous is usually prepared on Fridays for lunch, when whole
              families get together for the most important meal of the week. The
              dish is traditionally made in a metal steamer pot called a
              couscoussier, where the stew is on the bottom, while the small
              grains are in the perforated basket on top, cooking in the steam
              that is rising from the rich stew. Although couscous dishes are
              often full of vegetables, they are rarely vegetarian.
